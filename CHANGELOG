Version 0.3.0, 16 July 2010:
----------------------------

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added tests infrastructure, code coverage is around 70%;
* import paths and class names are changed. Old class names and paths are
  deprecated but still work;
* ``dashboard.modules.AppList``, ``dashboard.modules.ModelList`` and
  ``menu.items.AppList`` now have ability to display any models from different
  apps (using glob syntax) via ``models`` and ``exclude`` parameters.
  The order is now preserved. See #15;
* implemented dashboard module groups : you can now group modules in tabs,
  accordion or in a stacked layout.

Bugfixes and minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* moved the menu and dashboard template dirs in a "admin_tools" directory to
  avoid name conflicts with other apps, for example: django-cms 
  (see: http://github.com/digi604/django-cms-2.0/issues/issue/397/);
* fixed bookmark bugs. The saved url was urlencoded, so we need to decode it
  before we save it. Added a clean_url method to the ``BookmarkForm``.
  Fixes #25;
* build urlpatterns conditionally regarding the content of ``INSTALLED_APPS``;
* better display of selected menu items;
* avoid a useless ajax GET request for retrieving dashboard preferences;
* upgraded jquery and jquery ui and renamed the files to more generic names;
* don't show bookmark form if ``NoReverseError``. This was breaking the 
  ``django.contrib.auth`` unit tests;
* fixed url lookup for remove bookmark form;
* fixed issue #26 (menu bar showing for non-staff users) and also updated
  templates to match the django 1.2 templates;
* fixed issue #29 : Django 1.2 admin base template change;
* changed the way js files are loaded, hopefully now they are loaded 
  syncronously (fixes issue #32);
* fixed issue #33: empty applist menu items should not be displayed;
* fixed issue #34: can't drag modules into an empty column;  
* fixed issue #35 (wrong docstring for menu).

Backwards incompatible changes in 0.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now, django-admin-tools stores menu and dashboard preferences in the database,
so you'll need to run syncdb and to add the django-admin-tools urls to your
urlconf. These steps are described in details in the documentation.
You'll also need to add ``admin_tools`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` for the
locales to work (this was not documented in previous versions).
