Backwards incompatible changes in 0.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now, django-admin-tools stores menu and dashboard preferences in the database, 
so you'll need to run syncdb and to add the django-admin-tools urls to your 
urlconf. These steps are described in details in the documentation.
You'll also need to add ``admin_tools`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` for the 
locales to work (this was not documented in previous versions).
